    Creating a Static Page
    ----------------------

    Pages with Symforium are parsed with [Markdown][0]. To get a brief synopsis of how to write markdown, [check out this guide][1].

    If there is something you can't do with Markdown, you will be able to simply use html. For example, to make a marquee, just use:

        <marquee>This is a marquee</marquee>

    <marquee>This is a marquee</marquee>
